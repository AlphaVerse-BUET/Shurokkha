2. Adjust for beneficiary count + crisis severity
3. Generate expected cost range (min-max with 90% confidence interval)
4. Flag applications >30% above maximum expected cost
5. Require itemized breakdown justification from provider
Output: Expected cost: ৳X-Y | Provider requested: ৳Z | Alert if Z > Y × 1.30
3.8 Impact Prediction
Input: Donation amount, crisis type, provider efficiency, historical outcomes
Model: LSTM Time-Series Forecaster
Predictions:
* "Your ৳10,000 will likely help 3-4 families based on regional costs"
* "This crisis will likely require ৳50 lakh total (current: ৳12 lakh raised)"
* "Provider X typically distributes within 6 days"
* Crisis escalation forecasting (monsoon flood severity predictions)
Output: Pre-donation impact estimate to guide donor decisions

10. SAMPLE USER STORIES
Story 1: Donor Experience
Rashed, Software Engineer, Dhaka
"I've always wanted to help during floods, but never trusted where my money went. Last week I saw 'Sylhet Flood - 300 families' on Shurokkha with satellite images and news links. I donated ৳10,000 and selected only 4+ star providers. Within 2 days, I got an SMS: 'Your ৳10,000 matched with Sylhet Relief Society for 3 families.' I could see their names (they chose not to hide), their village, and the provider's plan. After 5 days, I received photos of the families receiving relief materials—GPS-tagged, faces matched their NIDs. They even sent me a thank-you video. I can see on the map exactly where my money went. Best ৳10,000 I've ever spent. Now I've set up ৳5,000 monthly auto-donations."
Story 2: Provider Experience
BRAC Khulna Branch Manager
"We've been doing disaster relief for 15 years, but fundraising was always hard. With Shurokkha, we registered, uploaded our documents, and within a week got our first match—৳50,000 for 10 flood-affected families. The platform is so smooth: we submitted beneficiary NIDs and damage photos, AI verified them instantly (flagged one duplicate which we corrected), funds were released 50% upfront. We distributed rice, tarps, and medicine, uploaded GPS-tagged photos, and got the remaining 50% within 24 hours. Our trust score is now 95, and we're getting 20+ donation matches per week. The transparency actually makes donors trust us MORE, and the AI prevents fraud, so we don't compete with fake NGOs anymore."
Story 3: Beneficiary Experience
Amina, Cyclone Victim, Satkhira
"The cyclone destroyed our house last month. I heard about Shurokkha from our local chairman. I applied directly using my phone—uploaded my NID, damage photos, and chairman's certificate. Within 3 days, I got an SMS: 'Your application verified, matched with Coastal Relief Organization.' The provider visited us, confirmed the damage, and within a week we received ৳20,000 for rebuilding materials (tin sheets, cement, bamboo). They took photos with GPS, I confirmed via SMS. I could choose to hide my name publicly (I did), so only the provider knows who I am. Now my family has a roof again. I never dealt with corruption or middlemen. Thank you, Shurokkha."
Story 4: Admin Experience
Platform Operations Manager
"Last Tuesday, our AI flagged a provider '(ABC Relief' for suspicious activity: same 5 NIDs appeared in another application last week, costs were 60% above average, and 3 photos had edited timestamps. I reviewed the evidence in 10 minutes—called 2 beneficiaries, their numbers were invalid. Clear fraud attempt. I rejected the application, added them to the blacklist, and sent a warning. The next day, they tried again with different NIDs—AI caught it instantly (same IP, device fingerprint matched). Permanent ban. Before Shurokkha's AI, this would've taken weeks of manual investigation, and they might've stolen lakhs. Now it takes minutes, and we prevent fraud before it happens."
